Update tox.ini for py27 requirement

Reactive source charms are Python3-only, but have py27 unit tests
declared in project-config.

The Tox tool recently changed behavior.  It used to pass when a tox
target was missing commands.  Now it fails in that case.

This commit places a py27 no-op shim to allow gate tests to pass,
effectively restoring the original behavior for these py3x-only repos.
