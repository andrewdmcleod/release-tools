## To-Do
Note:  This initial set of scripts came about in a bit of a hurry when charm store ingestion was down, and OpenStack charms needed to be pushed to cs: en masse for the first time ever (@16.04).

* Add notes for not-automated scripts.
* Refactor and streamline into a cleaner charm-pusher python module which reads a centralized list of charms and series, expressed in yaml.
* Wait for charm-tools and charm store stabilize, perhaps aim for Juju 2.0.1 or 2.1 timeframe?
* Better yet, ideally rely solely on charm series metadata and act accordingly.
